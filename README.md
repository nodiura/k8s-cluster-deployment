# k8s-cluster-deployment
This Terraform config can deploy Kubernetes clusters on multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP), that Terraform modules can use to maintain a structured and logical setup. Each module will handle the infrastructure for the Kubernetes clusters separately, preparing configurations for EKS (AWS), AKS (Azure), and GKE (GCP)
